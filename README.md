# Hospital Management Software

This is a project for the "Software Project" course. The software aims to provide comprehensive functionalities for hospital management.

### üìã Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have PyQt5 installed, which is the library used to develop the graphical interface. You can install it using pip, the Python package manager, with the following command:
  
  - [$ pip install PyQt5]

Additionally, you need to have Python installed on your system. 

So, the prerequisites to run the project are:

* Installed Python

* Installed PyQt5

## üõ†Ô∏è Built with

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language
  - [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  - [Visual Studio Code Installation Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/)

* [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) - Library for developing graphical interfaces in Python
  - [$ pip install PyQt5]

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the tests

With PyQt5 properly installed and the project directory open in the Command Prompt, type "python Main.py", or execute the Main file using the "run" button in Visual Studio Code. To test user functionalities, sign up and explore the available options for the user.

To access the doctor's functionalities, make sure you're on the doctor login screen. For testing purposes, there is already a doctor registered with the following credentials:

CRM : 123456-SP

Password: 123

However, you can also register a doctor through the server functionalities.

To access server functionalities, in this case, a manager, use the following login:

Email: gerente@gmail.com

Password: 123

This way, you can test the options available for a manager.

## üìå Version

Version with a graphical interface, elements of the object-oriented paradigm, and the 'Facade' design pattern.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Authors

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Add automated tests to ensure software stability.
- Consider adding new functionalities based on community feedback.
- Enhance the graphical interface by implementing a dialog system to indicate errors.

## User Screen
This should be the first screen when running the program. In the image, two buttons are highlighted that will switch between screens.
