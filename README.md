# Hospital Management Software

This is a project for the "Software Project" course. The software aims to provide comprehensive functionalities for hospital management.

### üìã Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to run the project is to have Python installed, as the libraries used are native to Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built with

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language
  - [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  - [Visual Studio Code Installation Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/)


## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the tests

With the project directory open in the Command Prompt, type "python Main.py" and follow the information presented in the terminal. To test user functionalities, simply choose the corresponding option in the main menu. After that, register or log in and explore the available options for a user.

To access doctor functionalities, make sure you are on the program's home screen and choose the option related to the doctor. Next, the login screen will appear. For testing purposes, there is already a registered doctor with the following credentials:

Email: med_teste@gmail.com
Password: 123
However, you can also register a doctor through the server functionalities.

To access server functionalities, in this case, a manager, use the following login:

Email: gerente@gmail.com
Password: 123
This way, you can test the options available for a manager.

üìÑ Implementations
1. **~~Patient Registration~~**
2. **~~Appointment Scheduling~~**
3. **~~Medical Record Management~~**
4. **~~Billing and Invoicing~~**
5. **~~Prescription Management~~**
6. **~~Lab Test Ordering and Reporting~~**
7. **~~Ward and Bed Management~~**
8. **~~Inventory Management~~**
9. **~~Staff Scheduling~~**
10. **Emergency Services Management**, I couldn't see how this functionality would be inserted into the program, as the software is not focused on the urgent and emergency area of a hospital, but rather on scheduling appointments and exams.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Add automated tests to ensure software stability.
- Consider adding new functionalities based on community feedback.
